        <h1>Cat causes chaos for local family</h1>
        <h2><em>Written by Celia Roush</em></h2>
        <p>When the Roush adopted a kitten, they did not expect that 
        this cat was a chaos gremlin. The Roush's found their cat
        when she was she was about a day old,
            <q>She was so young,</q>, 
        Angie Roush reports, 
            <q>Her mother was no where to be seen, so we took her home.</q> 
        Little did they know, the cat would end up being a chaotic
        creature, causing problems way too often.
        </p>
        <p> Brunhidle, Bruni for short, would end up scraching and biting
        everyone, stealing hair ties and hiding them under her cat 
        tower, and begging for food ever ten minutes.
        <blockquote>She often goes by the door to try and go outside,
            but when she's outside, she just flops on the ground and
            sleeps - Ginny Roush </blockquote>

        </p>
        <p>The other Roush daughter reports that Bruni often likes to 
        climb windows. 
            <q>She thinks she spiderman, or spidercat</q>
        Will Bruni ever behave like a normal cat? Only time will tell
